# First Ruby on Rails Website

Following along with freeCodeCamps intorduction to Ruby on Rails. While it is a 'code along' it is by no means easy nor was it brain dead copy and paste for the following reasons: 

- Setting up Ruby on Rails was frustrating and tested ones patience, grit, and will to live. It took a fair amount of trial and error to get it up and running. 
- Because of the mutiple versions there were some differences in folder / file structure of setting up, say, devise for user login and authenticiation. 
- While on devise, there were mutiple issues almost every step of the way. Sing-in, sign-up, sign-out, not update profile worked. That is because of version differences so mutiple config changed had to be made.
- Using Bootstrap for styling did help but there were often unexpected errors and sometimes the code did not behave as expected. 

While the above issues were annoying it also provided a massive learning opportunity that I would not have had otherwise. I had to think of the issue in order to effectivly google the solution. I also got aqcuited with the complicated file/folder structure.
